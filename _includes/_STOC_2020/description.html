    <b>Description:</b> Social threats for individuals and organizations are prevalent in online conversations, where human vulnerabilities pave the way for phishing, propaganda, scams, and other social engineering tactics (Bakhshi, Papadaki, and Furnell 2008, Karakasilitiosis, Furnell, and Papadaki 2006). Over 80% of cyber penetrations start with a social engineering attack (Verizon/TM 2014), often through manipulative language usage, resulting in a loss of money, sensitive information, or control of resources to unsuspecting victims. Detection techniques based on metadata have yielded minimal success in the face of rising personalized attacks, especially those involving impersonation and power relationships (e.g., a spoofed dean requesting a gift card purchase from a department faculty). Natural language processing (NLP) and computational sociolinguistics techniques in conjunction with metadata analysis can provide a better means for detecting and countering such attacks for a wide variety of online conversations (Dalton et al 2019, Kim et al 2018, Dalton et al 2017, Sawa et al 2016). The STOC (Social Threats in Online Conversations: Understanding and Management) workshop is the first dedicated to gleaning actions and intentions of adversaries in social engineering attacks from the adversariesâ€™ language use as well as the content of communication with their targets.
