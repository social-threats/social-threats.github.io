    <b>Description:</b> Social threats for individuals and organizations are prevalent in online conversations, where human vulnerabilities pave the way for phishing, propaganda, scams, disinformation campaigns, and social engineering tactics (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/891e/464724909ba055438630ce0bf3564cb8c0df.pdf">Bakhshi, Papadaki, and Furnell 2008</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26503466?seq=1">Karakasilitiosis, Furnell, and Papadaki 2007</a>). For example, over 80% of cyber penetrations start with a social engineering attack (Verizon/TM 2014), often through manipulative language usage, resulting in a loss of money, sensitive information, or control of resources to unsuspecting victims at an individual level. Detection techniques based on metadata have yielded minimal success in the face of rising personalized attacks, especially those involving impersonation and power relationships (e.g., a spoofed dean requesting a gift card purchase from a department faculty). The implications are potentially more dire for disinformation campaigns, as these are implemented on a much larger scale. Natural language processing (NLP) and computational sociolinguistics techniques in conjunction with metadata analysis can provide a better means for detecting and countering attacks and disinformation campaigns in a wide variety of online, conversational contexts (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335568065_Modeling_Social_Engineering_Risk_using_Attitudes_Actions_and_Intentions_Reflected_in_Language_Use">Dalton et al 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/pubdir/harris_whitepaper.pdf">Kim et al 2018</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8258509">Dalton et al 2017</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7439345">Sawa et al 2016</a>). The STOC (Social Threats in Online Conversations: Understanding and Management) workshop is the first dedicated to gleaning actions and intentions of adversaries in online conversations, from the adversariesâ€™ language use coupled with communication content.
