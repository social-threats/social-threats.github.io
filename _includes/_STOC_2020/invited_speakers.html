                        <li><b>Abstract: </b>Misinformation – false information passed off as factual – is an effective weapon in the information age and has become widely used to influence people’s attitudes and behavior on social media. For instance, the Russian Internet Research Agency’s information warfare campaign supported Donald Trump’s successful candidacy in the 2016 United States presidential election, with some arguing that their efforts were effective facilitating Trump’s electoral college victory (Jamieson, 2018). In this talk, I examine the complex relationship between people’s social media use and their susceptibility to information warfare campaigns intended to sow mis- and disinformation. To accomplish this, the literature on social influence and persuasion via social media will be reviewed, focusing on the role that perceived social norms, cognitive dissonance, obedience to authority, and the viral nature of social media content play on people’s willingness to believe mis- and disinformation attempts.  This talk concludes with a discussion of potential strategies that individuals, policy makers, and technology companies could adopt to aid in protecting unsuspecting people from these types of influence operations.</li>
